Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

# Laravel Socialmedia project
This project is combining two of my previously created apps to create a social media platform.

# Usage
Install NPM package before running the code
```sh
 npm install      
```
Run the command (default port: '8000')
sebelum php artisan serve, ketik npm run dev
```sh
 npm run dev      
 php artisan serve 
```
